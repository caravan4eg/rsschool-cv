## 3. Summary

I am an engineer and have worked for many years in various positions in the design and construction of data and power networks. My goal in this course is to study a new profession. I already studied at RSSchool last year, but frequent business trips made it impossible to complete. Hopefully this year I will be able to finish my studies.

I have never worked as a programmer, I have experience in developing pet projects in python and django.

## 4. Skills

During my study of programming, I acquired the following skills:
- HTML/CSS
- VScode
- Python, Django
- Git
- PostgreSQL, LiteSQL

## 5. Code examples (LATEST)

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(add(99,55))
```

## 6. Experience

My interest to programming arose out of the need to process a lot of information when preparing tenders. To facilitate the work, a system for collecting and analyzing information was developed.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a system was developed to process data related to COVID.
